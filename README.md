## Tech stack:
* GraalVM 21
* Lombok
* Gradle

## Requirements
* GraalVM 21

## Build setup

### Jenkins

To set up continuous integration with Jenkins, use the `Jenkinsfile` located in the root of the project. Jenkins will
automatically detect and use this file when you configure your Jenkins job with the "Pipeline from SCM" option. This
will trigger the pipeline to build the project and create the `stream-api` native image

### GitHub Actions

To set up continuous integration with GitHub Actions, use the `.github/workflows/gradle.yml` file located in the root of
the repository. This file defines the steps required to build the project and create the `stream-api` native image

GitHub Actions will automatically detect and use this workflow when you push code to the repository. It will trigger the
defined steps, including setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the Gradle build tasks to
create the `stream-api` native image

### Manual

To manually build the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/hermippus/java-stream-api-example

# navigate to the project directory
$ cd java-stream-api-example

# build with Gradle (Jar)
$ ./gradlew build

# build with Gradle (Native Image)
$ ./gradlew nativeCompile
```

The jar file is located in `build/libs/`

The native image is located in `build/native/nativeCompile/`
